I loved the minimalism of this layout and the vibrancy of the colors. Ended up modeling the card style layout after this.

## Wireframe

Given the number of small details, I felt it was better to write out the wireframe on paper instead of using a tool like Balsamiq. Made sure there was ample amount of negative space to give each of the elements room to breath.

## Prototype

Used the OpenWeather API for the weather information and used the browser's built-in .getCurrentLocation() method for getlocation. Was a lot of fun writing the list transformations for the forecast data as well as iterating ont he animations until they felt right.
